This project has been made from scratch during my dev training (React).

My purpose was to build a complete MERN application (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

I followed a tutorial from the Youtube french channel "From Scratch" (links below).

Frontend part : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghdRD3pt8rg

To run the app locally, you will need to have Node and npm installed on your machine.

Then please follow these instructions :

- Create a MongoDB database and make sure you have admin access
- Clone the repository

- Copy/paste the [./backend/config/.env.example] file
- Rename the newly created `.env copy.example` file to `.env`
- Repeat this protocol with the [./frontend/.env.example] file
- Insert your MongoDB connection string into the `MONGODB_CREDENTIALS` field (don't forget to include your password)

- From the [./backend] folder, run `npm install` then `npm start`
- Your console should now be indicating "Listening on port 5000 - Connected to MongoDB"

- From the [./frontend] folder, run `npm install` then `npm start`

- You're done !

For the app to work perfectly, there must be an admin account.

Once an account will have been created, you will be able to upgrade it to an admin account by inserting its MongoDB ID into the `ADMIN_ID` and `REACT_APP_ADMIN_ID` fields of the `.env` files.

You will then have to restart both backend and frontend.
